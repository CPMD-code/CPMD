What is CPMD ?
==============

The CPMD code is a parallelized **plane wave / pseudopotential** implementation of Density Functional Theory, particularly designed for ab-initio molecular dynamics.

## History

The development of CPMD started in 1990 by a team of researchers at IBM Research Zurich. Between 1994 and 2001, the Max Planck Institute contributed to the development of the software. In 2001, a consortium has been established in order to coordinate the development and distribution of the CPMD code. The consortium was a virtual organization that comprises all the users and developers of the CPMD code around the world.  This organization was coordinated by [Dr. Alessandro Curioni](http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=zurich-cur) (Vice President Europe and Director of IBM Zurich Research Laboratory) and  was founded by [Prof. Michele Parrinello](http://www.rgp.ethz.ch) (USI) and [Prof. Wanda Andreoni](http://c3pn.epfl.ch/page-77528-en.html) (EPFL). In 2022, the CPMD code has been made freely available on GitHub under the MIT License.
