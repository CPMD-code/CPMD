*******************************************************************
UPDATED VERSION: 5 June 2014 (M. Boero)
COMPATIBILITY:   According to the selected keyword, compatibility
                 is ensured for Amber/AmberTools from version 6
                 to version 12 (released in 2013)
                 OpenMP directives have been included for faster
                 handling/conversion of big topologies/coordinates.
WHAT'S NEW: All routines are rewritten/reshaped as .F (capital
            case) as all the rest of the CPMD body. The Makefile
            has been extended to include most of the recent platforms
            and compilers. This same makefile can handle the .F
            pre-processing, producing .f and .o upon the
            command 'make'.
            As in the main code, the command 'make clean' 
            removes ALL the *.0 and *.f files.
*******************************************************************

Converts AMBER style coordinates and topology to 
GROMOS style coordinates, topology and input files.

WARNING: the AMBER-7, AMBER-8, and AMBER-9 versions have 
         a different topology format with respect to 
         AMBER-6 (now programmed).
         The latest version AMBER-12 (2013) has additional
         sections in the topology file (ATOMIC_NUMBER,
         SCEE_SCALE_FACTOR and SCNB_SCALE_FACTOR) that
         are properly handled only if you use the -D_AMBER12
         keyword in the compiling phase (see Makefile for
         details)

IMPORTANT CHANGES: as of version 0.7 a small bug in the 
          conversion of the angle potentials was fixed 
          resulting in slightly different forces and 
          energies (now consistent with AMBER).

          Versions before 0.9 did not handle water potentials
          with two bonds and an angle correctly (TIP3P in AMBER
          usually uses three bonds, but to run AMBER inputs in
          NAMD this has to be changed) in the (now default)
          rigid water potential case.

Usage:
ambertogromos.x [-flexible|-rigid] [-pdb] AMBERTOPOLOGY AMBERCOORDINATES

As of version 0.6 you can optionally select whether
you want to keep water molecules as rigid solvent
molecules or convert them to flexible and merge
them with the solute. 

use the -fl[exible] or -ri[gid] flags to select
any of those options. -rigid is currently default.

As of version 0.91 you can use the -pdb flag to read
the coordinates from a (standard conforming) .pdb file.

NOTE: if you want to keep the water molecules flexible,
it is strongly recommended, that you already use a flexible
water potential for the classical pre-equilibration. 
flexible water potentials have an intrinsic polarizability
and thus the charge distribution has to be different from
rigid potentials. the default water potential in amber
is the rigid TIP3P potential, hence the converter assumes
by default a rigid potential.

Some or all water molecules can always be converted 
to flexible water from within CPMD (e.g. to make them 
quantum atoms) using the FLEXIBLE WATER keyword. see
the CPMD manual for details.

The main is in conv.F.

In order to get the executables, brutally type

make

after changing/setting the proper compiler and options
in the Makefile !
